## What You Need to Do

### 1. **Add More References** (if needed)
The references section has generic citations. You may want to add:
- Papers on LLMs in interview systems
- Speech recognition research
- NLP evaluation methods

### 2. **Add Figures** (optional)
Replace the placeholder in Figure 1 with actual system architecture diagram

### 3. **Review Content**
- Verify all technical details match your actual system
- Check that file paths are correct
- Ensure metric numbers are realistic

### 4. **Run LaTeX**
```bash
pdflatex PAPER_CORRECTED.tex
bibtex PAPER_CORRECTED (if you add .bib file)
pdflatex PAPER_CORRECTED.tex
pdflatex PAPER_CORRECTED.tex
```
