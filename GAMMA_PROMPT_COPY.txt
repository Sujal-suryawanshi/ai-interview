Slide 1: Title Slide
- Title: "AI Interview System: Adaptive Mock Interview Platform with LLMs and Voice Interface"
- Authors: Anish Shinde, Rohit Kashid, Sujal Suryawanshi
- AISSMS Institute of Information Technology, Pune
- 2025

Slide 2: Problem & Solution
Problem:
- Limited access to interview practice
- Inconsistent feedback quality
- Time-consuming manual screening for recruiters
Solution:
- AI-driven automated interview system
- Voice-based interaction with real-time transcription
- Personalized adaptive questioning
- Comprehensive AI-powered evaluation

Slide 3: System Architecture
Flow Diagram showing:
Resume Input → LLM Parser → Question Generator → Voice Interface (TTS)
User Response → Speech-to-Text → Response Analysis → Scoring Engine (LLM)
Report Generator → Interview Report with Scores
Key Technologies: LiteLLM (Mistral Large), Speechmatics API (Real-time STT), Edge-TTS (Text-to-Speech), Streamlit (Web Interface)

Slide 4: Key Features
1. Resume Parsing - LLM extracts candidate info from PDF
2. Adaptive Questions - Personalized based on resume & job description
3. Voice Interface - 4 AI voices, real-time transcription
4. AI Evaluation - 0-10 scoring with detailed feedback
5. Real-time Adaptation - Questions adjust based on responses

Slide 5: Results & Performance
Metrics:
Transcription Accuracy: 95%+ for clear audio
Latency: <1 second (transcription), 2-3 seconds (question generation)
Successfully completed 10+ mock interviews
Average interview duration: 15-20 minutes
Testing Results: Contextually relevant question generation, accurate resume parsing, coherent scoring and feedback, natural conversation flow

Slide 6: Comparison & Differentiators
Comparison Table: Sharma et al. (CV+NLP), Mandal et al. (Emotion/Confidence), Our System (Voice+NLP)
Our system is the ONLY one with: Adaptive LLM-based question generation, Real-time voice interaction with adaptation, Open-source with resume-driven personalization
Key Differentiator: Content-focused approach using LLM-based semantic evaluation instead of nonverbal cues

Slide 7: Future Work & Conclusion
Future Enhancements: Multimodal analysis (CV for facial expressions), Emotion recognition, Multi-language support, Dynamic difficulty adjustment, HR system integration
Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated automated resume analysis, adaptive question generation, real-time voice interaction, and comprehensive evaluation. Modular architecture enables future multimodal enhancements.
